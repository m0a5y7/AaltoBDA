# Introduction

In this group project for the Bayesian Data Analysis course, the survival of Rick and Morty characters (from the Rick and Morty API) were predicted. In doing so, the performance of three models were compared. We found that although the hierarchical time series model performs the best at the predictions, removing the time series element reveals other aspects of the data that could be predicted more accurately. For future research the dataset should be supplemented with more attributes to conduct an even more complete analysis.

# Methods

Three Bayesian predictive models were constructed: two time series models one non-time series model. Two of the models were also hierarchical, meaning that they take into account a potential group effect in the prediction. The models as well as the resulting plots were programmed with R.
