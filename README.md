# Introduction

In this group project for the Bayesian Data Analysis course, the survival of Rick and Morty characters (from the Rick and Morty API) were predicted. 

# Methods

Three Bayesian predictive models were constructed: two time series models one non-time series model. Two of the models were also hierarchical, meaning that they take into account a potential group effect in the prediction. The models as well as the resulting plots were programmed with R.
